## About

Crypto currency(cc) wallets and daemons management could be time consuming task,
so here this project comes:
   * Easy to **prepare** fresh installed **machine** or virtual machine for cc GUI wallets or CLI daemons
   * Easy to manage **multiple wallet versions**
   * Easy to manage **multiple blockchain directories**
   * Easy to manage **multiple wallet.dat files**
   * Easy to use **predefined CLI commands** for each wallet instance separately
   * Easy to make and **share custom build configurations** between developers, testers,...
   * Easy to **make custom profiles** by changing few lines of configuration
   * Easy to **setup Blocknet+XBridge+DxBot+trading/liquidity-Strategy**
   * Easy to setup **private, opensource and truly-decetralized liquidity pools** that directly doing atomic-swaps between native wallets like BTC-LTC, DOGE-LTC, XVG, ...
   * Whole build process and wallet security **protection by firejail sandbox**
   * Whole build process and wallet **network privacy protection by TOR**
   * Easy to **test untrusted wallets in secured environment** because build-in system/network protection
   * Every build, script, wallet, cli, daemon is completely isolated from other user-space files, even if it looks like apps are running native way, they are isolated.
   * And little bit more...
